*Isaiah

ch1
1 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz which he beheld concerning Judea and Jerusalem during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah:
2 Hear, O heavens! Give heed, O earth!
Jehovah has spoken:
I have reared sons, brought them up,
but they have revolted against me.
3 The ox knows its owner,
the ass its master’s stall,
but Israel does not know;
my people are insensible.
4 Alas, a nation astray,
a people weighed down by sin,
the offspring of wrongdoers,
perverse children:
they have forsaken Jehovah,
they have spurned the Holy One of Israel,
they have lapsed into apostasy.
5 Why be smitten further
by adding to your waywardness?
The whole head is sick,
the whole heart diseased.
6 From the soles of the feet even to the head
there is nothing sound,
only wounds and bruises and festering sores;
they have not been pressed out or bound up,
nor soothed with ointment.
7 Your land is ruined,
your cities burned with fire;
your native soil is devoured by aliens in your presence,
laid waste at its takeover by foreigners.
8 The Daughter of Zion is left
like a shelter in a vineyard,
a hut in a melon field,
a city under siege.
9 Had not Jehovah of Hosts left us a few survivors,
we should have been as Sodom,
or become like Gomorrah.
10 Hear the word of Jehovah,
O leaders of Sodom;
give heed to the law of our God,
you people of Gomorrah!
11 For what purpose are your abundant
sacrifices to me? says Jehovah.
I have had my fill of offerings of rams
and fat of fatted beasts;
the blood of bulls and sheep and he-goats
I do not want.
12 When you come to see me,
who requires you to trample my courts so?
13 Bring no more worthless offerings;
they are as a loathsome incense to me.
As for convening meetings at the New Month
and on the Sabbath,
wickedness with the solemn gathering
I cannot approve.
14 Your monthly and regular meetings
my soul detests.
They have become a burden on me;
I am weary of putting up with them.
15 When you spread forth your hands,
I will conceal my eyes from you;
though you pray at length, I will not hear—
your hands are filled with blood.
16 Wash yourselves clean:
remove your wicked deeds
from before my eyes;
cease to do evil.
17 Learn to do good: demand justice,
stand up for the oppressed;
plead the cause of the fatherless,
appeal on behalf of the widow.
18 Come now, let us put it to the test,
says Jehovah:
though your sins are as scarlet,
they can be made white as snow;
though they have reddened as crimson,
they may become white as wool.
19 If you are willing and obey,
you shall eat the good of the land.
20 But if you are unwilling and disobey,
you shall be eaten by the sword.
By his mouth Jehovah has spoken it.
21 How the faithful city
has become a harlot!
She was filled with justice;
righteousness made its abode in her,
but now murderers.
22 Your silver has become dross,
your wine diluted with water.
23 Your rulers are renegades,
accomplices of robbers:
with one accord they love bribes
and run after rewards;
they do not dispense justice to the fatherless,
nor does the widow’s case come before them.
24 Therefore the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts,
the Valiant One of Israel, declares,
Woe to them! I will relieve me
of my adversaries,
avenge me of my enemies.
25 I will restore my hand over you
and smelt away your dross as in a crucible,a
and remove all your alloy.
26 I will restore your judges as at the first,
and your counsellors as in the beginning.
After this you shall be called
the City of Righteousness, a faithful city.
27 For Zion shall be ransomed by justice,
those of her who repent by righteousness.
28 But criminals and sinners
shall be altogether shattered
when those who forsake Jehovah are annihilated.
29 And youb will be ashamed of the oaks you cherished
and blush for the parks you were fond of;
30 you shall become like an oak whose leaves wither,
and as a garden that has no water.
31 The mighty shall be as refuse,
and their works a spark;
both shall burn up alike,
and there shall be none to extinguish.

ch2
1 A prophecy concerning Judea and Jerusalem which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw in vision:
2 In the latter days
the mountain of Jehovah’s house
shall become established
as the head of the mountains;
it shall be preeminent among the hills,
and all nations will flow to it.
3 Many peoples shall go, saying,
Come, let us go up
to the mountain of Jehovah,
to the house of the God of Jacob,
that he may instruct us in his ways,
that we may follow in his paths.
For out of Zion shall go forth the law,
and from Jerusalem the word of Jehovah.
4 He will judge between the nations
and arbitrate for many peoples.
They will beat their swords into plowshares,
their spears into pruning hooks:
nation will not lift the sword against nation,
nor will they learn warfare any more.
5 O house of Jacob, come,
let us follow the light of Jehovah.
6 For you, O Jehovah, have forsaken your people,
the house of Jacob, because,
like the Philistines,
they provide themselves with
mystics from the East
and are content with the infantile heathen.
7 Their land is full of silver and gold
and there is no end to their wealth;
their land is full of horses
and there is no end to their chariots.
8 Their land is full of idols:
they adore the works of their hands,
things their own fingers have made.
9 Mankind is brought low
when men thus debase themselves.
Forbear them not!
10 Go into the rocks; hide in the dust
from the awesome presence of Jehovah
and from the brightness of his glory.
11 The haughty eyes of men shall be lowered
and man’s pride abased;
Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.
12 Jehovah of Hosts has a day in store
for all the proud and arrogant
and for all who are exalted,
that they may be brought low.
13 It shall come against all the lofty
cedars of Lebanon that lift themselves up high,
and against all the oaks of Bashan,
14 against all high mountains and elevated hills,
15 against every tall tower and reinforced wall,
16 against [all vessels at sea,]
both merchant ships and pleasure craft.
17 The haughtiness of men shall be abased,
and man’s pride brought low;
Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.
18 He will utterly supplant the false gods.
19 Men will go into caves in the rocks
and holes in the ground,
from the awesome presence of Jehovah
and from the brightness of his glory,
when he arises and strikes terror on earth.
20 In that day men will throw away
to the moles and to the bats
their idols of silver and gods of gold
which they have made for themselves
to adore.
21 Men will go into crevices in the rocks
and fissures in the cliffs,
from the awesome presence of Jehovah
and from the brightness of his glory,
when he arises and strikes terror on earth.
22 Desist from the things of man,
in whose nostrils is but breath!
For of what consideration is he?

ch3
1 Even now, the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts,
deprives Judea and Jerusalem
of both staff and crutch—
all food supply and water supply,
2 the valiant man and soldier,
the magistrate and prophet, the augur and elder,
3 the officer and dignitary,
advisers, skilled craftsmen, and orators.
4 I, Jehovah, will make adolescents their rulers;
delinquents will lord it over them.
5 People will oppress one another,
every man his neighbor.
The young will be insolent to the elderly,
the vile to the honorable.
6 Then will a man apprehend a kinsman
of his father’s house, and say,
You have a tunic: be our leader
and take charge of this ruination!
7 But he will raise his hand in that day
and swear, I am no physician.
There is neither food nor clothing in my house;
you cannot make me a leader of the people.
8 Jerusalem will falter and Judea fall
because their tongue and their actions
are contrary to Jehovah,
an affront to his glory before his very eyes.
9 The look on their faces betrays them:
they flaunt their sin like Sodom;
they cannot hide it.
Woe to their souls;
they have brought disaster upon themselves!
10 Tell the righteous it shall be well with them;
they shall eat the fruits of their own labors.
11 But woe to the wicked
when calamity overtakes them:
they shall be paid back
for the deeds they have done!
12 As for my people, babes subject them;
women wield authority over them.
O my people, your leaders mislead you,
abolishing your traditional ways.
13 Jehovah will take a stand and contend with them;
he has arisen to judge the nations.
14 He will bring to trial the elders of his people
and their rulers, and say to them,
It is you who have devoured the vineyard;
you fill your houses by depriving the needy.
15 What do you mean by oppressing my people,
humbling the faces of the poor?
says Jehovah of Hosts.
16 Jehovah says, moreover,
Because the women of Zion are haughty
and put on airs, painting their eyes,
ever flirting when they walk
and clacking with their feet,
17 my Lord will afflict the scalps
of the women of Zion with baldness;
Jehovah will expose their private parts.
18 In that day my Lord will strip away their finery—the anklets, head ornaments and crescents,
19 the pendants, chains and scarves,
20 tiaras, bracelets and ribbons, zodiac signs and charm amulets,
21 the rings, the noselets,
22 the elegant dress, the shawl, the kerchief and the purse,
23 hosiery, sheer linen, millinery, and cloaks.
24 And instead of perfume there shall be a stench,
instead of the girdle, a piece of twine,
instead of the coiffure, baldness,
instead of the festive dress, a loincloth of burlap;
for in place of beauty
there shall be ignominy.
25 Your men shall be felled by the sword,
your might overthrown in war.
26 Her gateways shall lie bereaved and forlorn;
she shall sit on the ground destitute.

ch4
1 Seven women will take hold of one man
in that day, and say,
We will eat our own food,
wear our own clothes,
only let us be called by your name—
take away our reproach!
2 In that day the plant of Jehovah shall be beautiful and glorious, and the earth’s fruit the pride and glory of the survivors of Israel.
3 Then shall they who are left in Zion and they who remain in Jerusalem be called holy—all who were inscribed to be among the living at Jerusalem.
4 This shall be when my Lord has washed away the excrement of the women of Zion and cleansed Jerusalem of its bloodshed, in the spirit of justice, by a burning wind.
5 Over the whole site of Mount Zion, and over its solemn assembly, Jehovah will form a cloud by day and a mist glowing with fire by night: above all that is glorious shall be a canopy.
6 It shall be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, a secret refuge from the downpour and from rain.
