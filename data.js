  "Isaiah": {
    "Chapter 1": [
      "The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz which he beheld concerning Judea and Jerusalem during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah:",
      "Hear, O heavens! Give heed, O earth!\nJehovah has spoken:\nI have reared sons, brought them up,\nbut they have revolted against me.",
      "The ox knows its owner,\nthe ass its master\u2019s stall,\nbut Israel does not know;\nmy people are insensible.",
      "Alas, a nation astray,\na people weighed down by sin,\nthe offspring of wrongdoers,\nperverse children:\nthey have forsaken Jehovah,\nthey have spurned the Holy One of Israel,\nthey have lapsed into apostasy.",
      "Why be smitten further\nby adding to your waywardness?\nThe whole head is sick,\nthe whole heart diseased.",
      "From the soles of the feet even to the head\nthere is nothing sound,\nonly wounds and bruises and festering sores;\nthey have not been pressed out or bound up,\nnor soothed with ointment.",
      "Your land is ruined,\nyour cities burned with fire;\nyour native soil is devoured by aliens in your presence,\nlaid waste at its takeover by foreigners.",
      "The Daughter of Zion is left\nlike a shelter in a vineyard,\na hut in a melon field,\na city under siege.",
      "Had not Jehovah of Hosts left us a few survivors,\nwe should have been as Sodom,\nor become like Gomorrah.",
      "Hear the word of Jehovah,\nO leaders of Sodom;\ngive heed to the law of our God,\nyou people of Gomorrah!",
      "For what purpose are your abundant\nsacrifices to me? says Jehovah.\nI have had my fill of offerings of rams\nand fat of fatted beasts;\nthe blood of bulls and sheep and he-goats\nI do not want.",
      "When you come to see me,\nwho requires you to trample my courts so?",
      "Bring no more worthless offerings;\nthey are as a loathsome incense to me.\nAs for convening meetings at the New Month\nand on the Sabbath,\nwickedness with the solemn gathering\nI cannot approve.",
      "Your monthly and regular meetings\nmy soul detests.\nThey have become a burden on me;\nI am weary of putting up with them.",
      "When you spread forth your hands,\nI will conceal my eyes from you;\nthough you pray at length, I will not hear\u2014\nyour hands are filled with blood.",
      "Wash yourselves clean:\nremove your wicked deeds\nfrom before my eyes;\ncease to do evil.",
      "Learn to do good: demand justice,\nstand up for the oppressed;\nplead the cause of the fatherless,\nappeal on behalf of the widow.",
      "Come now, let us put it to the test,\nsays Jehovah:\nthough your sins are as scarlet,\nthey can be made white as snow;\nthough they have reddened as crimson,\nthey may become white as wool.",
      "If you are willing and obey,\nyou shall eat the good of the land.",
      "But if you are unwilling and disobey,\nyou shall be eaten by the sword.\nBy his mouth Jehovah has spoken it.",
      "How the faithful city\nhas become a harlot!\nShe was filled with justice;\nrighteousness made its abode in her,\nbut now murderers.",
      "Your silver has become dross,\nyour wine diluted with water.",
      "Your rulers are renegades,\naccomplices of robbers:\nwith one accord they love bribes\nand run after rewards;\nthey do not dispense justice to the fatherless,\nnor does the widow\u2019s case come before them.",
      "Therefore the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts,\nthe Valiant One of Israel, declares,\nWoe to them! I will relieve me\nof my adversaries,\navenge me of my enemies.",
      "I will restore my hand over you\nand smelt away your dross as in a crucible,a\nand remove all your alloy.",
      "I will restore your judges as at the first,\nand your counsellors as in the beginning.\nAfter this you shall be called\nthe City of Righteousness, a faithful city.",
      "For Zion shall be ransomed by justice,\nthose of her who repent by righteousness.",
      "But criminals and sinners\nshall be altogether shattered\nwhen those who forsake Jehovah are annihilated.",
      "And you will be ashamed of the oaks you cherished\nand blush for the parks you were fond of;",
      "you shall become like an oak whose leaves wither,\nand as a garden that has no water.",
      "The mighty shall be as refuse,\nand their works a spark;\nboth shall burn up alike,\nand there shall be none to extinguish."
